# Assignment 07
## Intro
### Apologies, I simply did not have enough time to complete the assignment this week. I was able to modify my assignment 06 code to include some error handling and to pickle the data for use with a .dat file. The next few pages are screen shots of my program running in PyCharm (Fig. 1) and CMD (Fig. 2) I do not plan on working on this assignment any further and will be moving on to assignment 08.
